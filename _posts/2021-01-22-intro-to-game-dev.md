# Game Development - What, Why and How?

1. Game dev is a fun and interactive process where you shape your ideas into something enjoyable. A game is basically anything that you can interact with and have fun...
2. All of us have played several games throughout our lifetime, and have experienced the joy, thrill and fun of the games. As a game developer, you get to make those experiences. It's so awesome when you see someone play and enjoy a game you created, bring out the good and bad parts about it, and above all - you get to learn a lot of things starting from Programming to Game Art creation to sound designing and so much more. Even though each individual specializes in some or other aspects, but each of them needs to know the other skills and integrate them. It's such an interactive process of develping and learning that one just can't get away from it...
3. There are lots and lots of tutorials, resources, communities of budding and helping developers out there which will help you shape your ideas and learnings. I'll cover this in the below topic....

# Game Engines and Tools

A Game Engine is basically a platform where you develop your games... From a painter's perspective, think of it like a canvas alongwith brushes and colors and shaders... Except it's so much more... 
There are a variety of Game Engines out there, but the two most popular ones and you must have heard are **Unity** and **Unreal**...

As a beginner, I would suggest to use Unity... 
The main reasons being it's vast community, ease of use, great availibility of assets and lots and lots of tutorials...

Apart from Game Engines, you'll need some drawing tools like Photoshop, Clip Studio etc. (Pixlr is a great on-the-web tool for this stuff, if you don't wanna download things... But it's always good to work with the apps imo)... Clip Studio is my personal favorite as there are literally so-so many things you can do in it...

# Target Platforms

A vast variety of platforms are available for deploying your game.

The broad categories are:
1. Laptops based platforms like
    a. Windows
    b. Linux
    c. MAC OS
2. Mobile based platforms like
    a. Android
    b. iOS
3. Console based platforms like
    a. PlayStation
    b. Xbox
    c. Nintendo

The reason for this categorization is you need to think some aspect of your games based on the platform. While most of the things like the overall level, gameplay, logic and core concept remain same, some things might change based on the platform.

For example: You can provide different kind of combo moves for Console and Laptop based games, but it's not such a good option for the touch based Mobile platform. So, you might wanna replace the combo with a single Special Move button(just an example)...

And the overall feel, layout and the audience also change based on the platform type you are targeting. So, it's alwasy good to think which Target Platform you are planning to deploy your games on...
