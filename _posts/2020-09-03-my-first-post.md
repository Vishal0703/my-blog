Hi, I'll be logging my Game Development things from here on out. I have already been immersed in Game Development for the past couple of months. So, the logger will be a bidirectional logger. I'll be logging the things I m doing currently, as well as what I did at the start. So, it'll take a while before the both catch up. 

I'll be mainly writing about the concepts I learned, occasionly some tricks and common mistakes, alongwith relevant courses, youtube links and various other stuffs...
